# Download one recording session

In order to test the spikeA package with real data, we uploaded one recording session from a mouse with tetrodes in the entorhinal cortex.

There is a function in spikeA to download it to your computer.

If the function can't download the file for some reason, the link is in the docstring.

```
from spikeA.Downloads import download_spikeA_data_one_session
?download_spikeA_data_one_session
download_spikeA_data_one_session()
```
