# For developers

We will try to develop spikeA as a collaborative project within the lab. We will have to establish a few guidlines to make sure the code is consistant.

## Coding guidelines

1. Organize your code so that it is as readable as possible. See [Python style guidelines](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).
2. Class names are Captalized.
3. For attributes and methods: lowercase with words separated by underscores.
4. Document all Class, methods and function with a [docstring](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/).
