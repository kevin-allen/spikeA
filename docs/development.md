# For developers

We will try to develop spikeA as a collaborative project within the lab. We will have to establish a few guidlines to make sure the code is consistant.


## What you should know

### Git

The code for spikeA is stored in a GitHub repository. 
This means that you will need to use `git` to get the code and to update the repository with your changes. 
Try to learn a bit about how `git` is used. In the end, you will only need to use a few commands to do 95% of what you need (e.g., clone, commit, status, pull, push, etc.).

### Python

Most of the code will be in python. This means that some knowledge of python will be required. 
We will use the main python packages used for scientific computing: `numpy`, `scipy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib` and `scikit-learn`. 
These package are well-established and you can find usefull tutoirals and help online.
If you are not familiar with python, you might want to do a small online course before getting going.

Alternatively, you can read [`Python for Data Analysis`](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/python-for-data/9781491957653/) by Wes McKinney.

### Python environment

I would recommand to create a python environment to do your data analysis. More on this in how to install and use spikeA.

## Coding guidelines

1. Organize your code so that it is as readable as possible. See [Python style guidelines](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).
2. Class names are Captalized.
3. For attributes and methods: lowercase with words separated by underscores.
4. Document all Class, methods and function with a [docstring](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/).
