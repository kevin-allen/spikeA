# Unit testing

We are using `unittest` to minimize the chance of having bugs in our code.

This allows us to write a series of tests when developing a functionality, and store it so that we can re-run these tests anytime.

The test code is saved in the `tests` folder. 

More information about `unittest` is found [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html).

## Run a test

```
python -m unittest ~/repo/spikeA/tests/test_Spike_train.py
```
